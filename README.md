# Aureal

A macOS client driver for ASUS Aura enabled motherboards.

## Wait why?

It's _only_ really for Hackintosh setups. If your Apple hardware has an Aura setup, then things really have changed when I wasn't looking. Cool though.

## What's it do?

Just the basics. It'll allow you to set an effect mode and a colour.

Maybe one day we'll get there with fancier custom effects, but that'll require a bit of tinkering.

As far as I know, ASUS only ships a single controller that's used by different boards (vendor: `0x0b05`, product: `0x18f3`), so if your device isn't _that_, then good luck.

For me, I have an ASUS PRIME Z490-A, and a be quiet! Pure Base 500DX. The RGBs sync a-okay across the devices using this tool.

## Why doesn't it do X?

So far, this is just an afternoon of tinkering, so it's missing, well, a lot of features. But it's enough to get the shiny thing! ✨
